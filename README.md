# End-to-End Big Data Analytics Implementation: From Data Ingestion to Visualization
Project Objective
To provide hands-on experience in implementing a complete Big Data Analytics workflow, including data ingestion, processing, storage, analysis, and visualization using modern tools and frameworks.
Project Description
Real-world dataset to build an end-to-end analytics pipeline. The project will involve ingesting data from multiple sources, performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, analyzing data to generate insights, and visualizing results in a meaningful way.
## Project Workflow
1. Data Ingestion
Use tools like Apache Kafka, Flume to ingest structured and unstructured data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or log files.
Handle data in real-time (streaming) and batch modes.
2. Data Storage
Store ingested data in  MongoDB for scalability.
3. Data Processing
Process the raw data using Apache Spark  for large-scale data transformations and computations.
Perform data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation.
4. Data Analysis
Use Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
Apply machine learning models, if relevant, using libraries like scikit-learn or Spark MLlib.
5. Data Visualization
Visualize the insights using tools  Power BI, or Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Create dashboards and interactive reports to present findings effectively.
